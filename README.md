# Case1_HelloWorld

Traditionally, Hello World programs are used to illustrate how the process of coding works, as well as to ensure that a language or system is operating correctly. They are usually the first programs that new coders learn, because even those with little or no experience can execute Hello World both easily and correctly.

Above all, Hello World is simple. That’s why it is so often used as a barometer of program success. If Hello World does not work effectively within the framework, then it is likely that other, more complex programs will also fail. As one expert at Win-Vector opens in new windowputs it, Hello World is actually a confrontational program. “The author is saying ‘it isn’t obvious your computer system will work, so I am not going to invest a lot of time in it until I see it can at least print one line of text,’” Win-Vector blogger John Mount says.

But this two-word phrase has big implications for the field of computer science. With Hello World as a foundation, novice programmers can easily understand computer science principles or elements. And professionals with years of coding experience can use it to learn how a given programming language works, especially in terms of structure and syntax. With applications at all skill levels and in almost every language, there is a long history behind such a short program.[1]

 
* Install the Android Studio development environment.
* Create a an emulator (virtual device) to run your app on your computer.
* Create and run the Hello World app on the virtual and physical devices.
* Explore the project layout.
* Generate and view log statements from your app.
* Explore the AndroidManifest.xml file.
